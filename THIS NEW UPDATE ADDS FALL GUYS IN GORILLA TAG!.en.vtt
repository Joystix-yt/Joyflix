Hello everybody, and welcome back to

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.470 align:start position:0%
Joystix VR. Today, we are checking out

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.550 align:start position:0%
the new Gorilla Tag update. Yep, let’s get

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.470 align:start position:0%
right into it. So, I heard that Beach—

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.390 align:start position:0%
I heard that Beach changed the most. This is

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.710 align:start position:0%
my first time seeing Beach on this new

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.670 align:start position:0%
update, so I am

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.990 align:start position:0%
ready. Whoa, this is a full-on—

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.870 align:start position:0%
like water... Oh my God, this is like a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.710 align:start position:0%
full-on water burn.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.030 align:start position:0%
Guys, yo, this is actually a pretty cool

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.310 align:start position:0%
update.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.750 align:start position:0%
Yo, ain’t no way... Yo, yo, yo, where do you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.750 align:start position:0%
enter? Where do you

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.549 align:start position:0%
enter? Where do you

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.510 align:start position:0%
ready? Let’s

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.260 align:start position:0%
go! Oh, it started.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:14.109 align:start position:0%
[Music]

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.749 align:start position:0%
[Music] Guys, Gorilla attack! Guys, well, guys,

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.870 align:start position:0%
attack! Yo, more water park, more water

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
park.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:41.109 align:start position:0%
[Music]

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.910 align:start position:0%
[Music] Tag, real B guys, Gorilla Tag, real B guys.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.910 align:start position:0%
Gorilla Tag, real ball guys, Gorilla Tag,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.109 align:start position:0%
real ball guys, Gorilla Tag,

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.109 align:start position:0%
real out.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.190 align:start position:0%
Clowns, this feels like a water slide.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.230 align:start position:0%
Really? No, wait, did it change anything? I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.109 align:start position:0%
don’t think it changed anything, to be

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.469 align:start position:0%
honest. Oh, I see water, I see, I see fall

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.029 align:start position:0%
guys up there. Okay, we’re in the Fortnite—

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.550 align:start position:0%
I mean clouds map.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.110 align:start position:0%
Guys, Fall Guys x Fortnite Gorilla Tag.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.589 align:start position:0%
